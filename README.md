For this project, I use the AI Agents Jobs Ecosystem (2026) dataset, which contains job postings and descriptions related to emerging AI agent roles. Because this dataset reflects information from 2026, it is outside the knowledge cutoff of the LLM used in this project (October 2023), making retrieval-augmented generation necessary for accurate responses. The dataset contains rich natural language text and can be reused in later assignments for tasks such as classification, summarization, and fine-tuning.
